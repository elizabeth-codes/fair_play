      <p>Eve Rodsky is changing society one partnership at a time, by coming up with a 21st-century solution to an age-old problem: women shouldering the brunt of domestic responsibilities, regardless of whether they work outside the home. The unequal emotional labor and “invisible work” in a relationship is a hot-button issue, but no one has offered a real solution to this dilemma, until now. </p>
      <p>Rodsky surveyed more than 500 couples across the US to figure out WHAT the invisible work in a family actually is and HOW to get it done effectively–in a way that makes relationships even stronger. Fair Play identifies the 100 main tasks in any partnership and then divides those tasks fairly (not necessarily equally!) so that both parties contribute their share. If we don’t learn to rebalance our home life and reclaim our “unicorn time” (aka, our space to develop the skills and passions that keep us vibrant), then we risk losing our right to be interesting, not just to our partner, but to ourselves. </p>
      <p> Fair Play offers an innovative system with a completely original lexicon to discuss how relationships actually work … and how we can make them work better. </p>
